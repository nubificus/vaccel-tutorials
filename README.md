## vAccel tutorials

This repo contains a number of lab exercises that assist in the familiarization
with the vAccel framework.

[lab1](https://github.com/nubificus/vaccel-tutorials/tree/main/lab1) contains
instructions on how to build vAccelRT and execute the vAccel `hello-world`.

[lab2](https://github.com/nubificus/vaccel-tutorials/tree/main/lab2) describes
the process to add a new plugin to vAccel that implements a known, frontend
operation exposed to the upper layer framework of vAccelRT.

[lab3](https://github.com/nubificus/vaccel-tutorials/tree/main/lab3) describes
the process to expose & run an arbitrary function using vAccel.

[lab4](https://github.com/nubificus/vaccel-tutorials/tree/main/lab4) contains
instructions on how to run an arbitrary function using vAccel from a
Firecracker VM.

As we further develop the framework, more tutorials will be added. Stay tuned!
